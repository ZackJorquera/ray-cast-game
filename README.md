# Ray Cast
A small simple ray-casted 3d (ish) game. It uses the same method that wolfenstein 3d used to have "3d".

I built this using the OpenGL wrapper [glium](https://docs.rs/glium/0.27.0/glium/).

# To Run
Download the repo and run
```
cargo run --release 3d
```
or
```
cargo run --release 2d
```
